		<p class="name_3">"I'm just a friendly neighborhood Batman."</p>
		<p class="name_4">Batman is also known as the 'Caped Crusader', the 'World's Greatest Detective', and the 'Dark Knight'. While most superheroes have superpowers, Batman does not. He relies on his martial arts skills, detective skills, physical strength, intellect, wealth, technology, and will to face the criminals in Gotham City.
		Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth.</p>
